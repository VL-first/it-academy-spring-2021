# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to
# find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed
# that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check
# his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is
# different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means
# indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
